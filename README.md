This repository contains scripts and notes for performing various bioinformatic analyses. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference for myself and a portfolio of my work as an undergraduate researcher at the [Wang Lab](https://www.wang-lab.co).

NOTE: some of these scripts can be run locally, while others contain SLURM directives and are meant to be run on a High Performance Computer (HPC).

DISCLAIMER: some scripts (as indicated in each script) have been copied/modified from scripts written by other researchers at the Wang Lab.
