## Example Data

### Experimental Background
this analysis used data that was collected from a tumor organoid; 
the organoid cells lack a specific protein called ARID1A, which is part of a chromatin remodeler that is important for tumor supression.
in the experiment, ARID1A expression was induced at 0h, and RNA expression levels were measured at subsequent time points (12h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h)
thus, the 12h data represents the RNA expression levels 12 hours after ARID1A addback in perviously ARID1A-deficient tumor cells
the 0h time point serves as a "control" or baseline for comparison, because this represents zero ARID1A expression (tumor cells just prior to ARID1A addback)
