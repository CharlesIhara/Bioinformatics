These scripts were tested locally using a dataset from NCBI GEO with GEO accession number GSM104550.

The data can be downloaded from here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE104550

The data was generated from a CUT&RUN (Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease) experiment to study the binding behavior of CTCF, IgG, and K27me3 within the genome.

The data consists of BED and BEDGRAPH files, which contain information about the location and strength protein binding in the genome.
